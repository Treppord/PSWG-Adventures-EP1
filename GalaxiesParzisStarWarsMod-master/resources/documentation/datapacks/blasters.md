# Blaster Datapacks

Blasters require two components in a datapack to be available in-game:

* Model component
    * Defines how the item visually appears in-game
* JSON component
    * Defines the properties, statistics, and attachment definitions

## Model component

### Location

The mod searches for blaster models in the `assets/pswg/models/item/blaster` directory of a datapack. The name of the
model should be the same as the name of the accompanying JSON file. Textures for each model should share the same filename
in the directory `assets/pswg/textures/model/blaster` (unless specified otherwise, see [Structure](#structure)).

### Format

Blasters use a custom model format called P3D (Parzi 3D). P3D files can be obtained by compiling P3Di (Parzi 3D
Intermediary) models which can currently be exported by the following software:

* Blender (using addon: [io_scene_p3di](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parzivail-Modding-Team/GalaxiesParzisStarWarsMod/master/resources/blender_addons/io_scene_p3di.py))

#### Conventions

The following conventions will assume you're using Blender, and will use Blender terminology.

##### General Model Conventions

* Up is +Z. This is converted to +Y during compilation.
* Forward is +Y. This is converted to +Z during compilation.
* One pixel is 0.1m (10cm).
* The name of the Object becomes the name of the submesh.
* All Objects **must** have their *rotation* and *scale* transformations **applied** _(Ctrl+A, Rotation & Scale)_ before
  export.
    * The origin of an Object becomes the rotation point of a submesh in a compiled model.
* **Sockets** are defined by adding Empties of type Arrows _(Add, Empty, Arrows)_.
    * The name of the Empty becomes the name of the socket.
    * The axes as drawn directly correspond to the local coordinate space of the in-game object.
* Objects may use the scene hierarchy to define rotation-based parenting.
    * This applies to both Empties (sockets) and Objects (submeshes).
* All polygons must either be triangles (3 vertices) or quads (4 vertices). No polygon may be an "n-gon" (more than 4
  vertices).
  * A quick way to ensure this is to enter Edit mode _(Tab)_, select all _(A)_, Triangulate Faces _(Ctrl+T_ or _Face,
  Triangulate Faces)_, then convert to quads as desired _(Alt-J_ or _Face, Tris to Quads)_.
* Every material used on an exported Object must be named one of the following:
  * `MAT_DIFFUSE_OPAQUE`: No transparency will be applied. Uses standard diffuse lighting.
  * `MAT_DIFFUSE_CUTOUT`: Pixels will be rounded to full or zero opacity (cutout transparency). Uses standard diffuse lighting.
  * `MAT_DIFFUSE_TRANSLUCENT`: Partially translucent pixels will be rendered accordingly. Uses standard diffuse
    lighting.
  * `MAT_EMISSIVE`: Cutout transparency. All pixels will be rendered at full brightness regardless of lighting condition.

##### Blaster Model Conventions

* Blasters should be scaled such that the trigger is roughly three pixels (30cm) tall. This is a good reference because, 
  across guns, the trigger, and therefore trigger guard, does not scale with the caliber or firepower of the gun. You may
  find it helpful to compare your model against a blaster model in the [model resource folder](https://github.com/Parzivail-Modding-Team/GalaxiesParzisStarWarsMod/tree/master/resources/models).
* Blasters may __optionally__ define any of the following sockets:
  * `main_hand`: The position that will be gripped by the player's main hand. If undefined, the model origin will be used.
  * `off_hand`: The position *and orientation* of the player's offhand. If undefined, no offhand will be rendered.
  * `muzzle_flash`: The position and orientation of the default (see `muzzle_flash.[x]`) muzzle flash animation.
  * `muzzle_flash.[x]`: The position and orientation of the muzzle flash when an attachment named `x` is attached. For
    example: A hypothetical blaster has an attachment (and Object) named `long_barrel`. If a socket named `muzzle_flash.long_barrel`
    exists, the muzzle flash will render at that socket instead of the default `muzzle_flash` socket when that attachment is
    attached.
* All attachments should be visible when exported and in the location they should appear in-game.

#### Tips

* If you're exporting your model from BlockBench or any other program where the units are in "world space", i.e. one pixel
is 1/16th of a block, and therefore 1/16th of a meter, scale your model by `1.6` in all dimensions, and your model will
now have one pixel as 10cm, or 1/10th of a meter, which is the convention used in [General Model Conventions](#general-model-conventions).

#### Exporting a P3Di model

With the **io_scene_p3di** addon installed and enabled, simply _(File, Export, "Parzi 3D Intermediary (.p3di)")_, select
a filename and location for the exported model, and export. Only visible Objects will be exported.

#### Compiling a P3Di model into a P3D model

A tool called P3diTools is required to compile the model. Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/Parzivail-Modding-Team/P3diTools/releases).

From the command line in the directory where P3diTools is located, run the following command, replacing `/path/to/my_model.p3di`
with the absolute path of the P3Di model you exported in the previous step.

```
P3diTools compile -m /path/to/my_model.p3di
```

If all goes well, an output file called `my_model.p3d` will be created. If something goes wrong, the software will alert
you to the issue. The resulting P3D model is ready to use in-game.

In the command above, the `-m` option specifies that a model file (`p3d`) should be exported. You may find it helpful to
read the other processing and export options at your disposal by running the following command in the same manner as before:

```
P3diTools compile --help
```

## JSON Component

### Location

The mod searches for blaster descriptors in the `data/pswg/items/blasters` directory of a datapack. The name of the JSON
file is authoritative, that is, the name of the file becomes the ID of the blaster descriptor. For example, a file at `
data/pswg/items/blasters/a280.json` would be referred to as `pswg:a280` internally.

## Attachment System

The attachment system has four fundamental components:

* The blaster stack's attachment bitmap
* The attachment's unique bitfield
* The attachment's mutex bitmap
* The blaster's _minimum attachment_

For the following examples, three hypothetical attachments are defined:

```
              Bitfield  Mutex
Attachment A  00000001  00000001
Attachment B  00000010  00000110
Attachment C  00000100  00000110
```

Since both Attachments B and C share the same mutex, and the mutex is comprised of the bitfields for both Attachment B
and C, the blaster can have only one of B or C attached at any time. Hence, they are **mut**ually **ex**clusive. *(Note:
this example blaster must have exactly one of B and C attached at all times due to the later described **attachment
minimum**, see [Attachment Removal](#attachment-removal))*

The examples also consider the hypothetical blaster to have these initial properties:

```
Attachment bitmap    : 00000101
Attachment minumum   : 00000010
```

### Rendering

When a blaster is rendered, only the stack's attachment bitmap and each attachments' bitfield are considered. The
attachments of the example blaster are rendered as follows:

```
Attachment bitmap    : 00000101
                       ||||||||
Attachment A bitfield: 00000001
Attachment B bitfield: 00000010
Attachment C bitfield: 00000100
```

Because the first and third bits of the attachment bitmap are set, the attachments with bitfield `1` (Attachment A)
and `100` (Attachment C) are rendered, because their fields have the corresponding bits set.

### Attachment Addition

When an attempt is made to apply a new attachment, the system considers all four fundemental components.

Consider the example blaster, with has Attachment A and Attachment C:

```
Attachment bitmap    : 00000101
```

Suppose we wish to add Attachment B. First, the system uses the mutex of Attachment B to remove any attachments that are
mutually exclusive to it by clearing all bits from the attachment bitmap present in the mutex:

```
Attachment bitmap    : 00000101
                 CLEAR ||||||||
Attachment B mutex   : 00000110
                     = ||||||||
Resulting bitmap     : 00000001
```

Then, the attachment bitfield of Attachment B is set in the attachment bitmask:

```
Attachment bitmap    : 00000101
                   SET ||||||||
Attachment B bitfield: 00000010
                     = ||||||||
Resulting bitmap     : 00000011
```

The resulting bitmap is then stored in the stack.

### Attachment Removal

Suppose we wish to now remove Attachment B. First, the system clears the bit corresponding to Attachment B's bitfield:

```
Attachment bitmap    : 00000011
                 CLEAR ||||||||
Attachment B bitfield: 00000010
                     = ||||||||
Resulting bitmap     : 00000001
```

Then, the mutex of Attachment B is combined with the attachment minumum and the attachment bitmap to determine if the
attachment requirements are met:

```
Attachment bitmap    : 00000001
                   AND ||||||||
Attachment minimum   : 00000010
                   AND ||||||||
Attachment B mutex   : 00000110
                     = ||||||||
Resulting bitmap     : 00000000
```

Since the resulting bitmap is zero, no attachments in the set defined by Attachment B's mutex are present. Therefore,
the required attachment from the attachment minimum is selected.

```
Attachment minimum   : 00000010
                   AND ||||||||
Attachment B mutex   : 00000110
                     = ||||||||
Required attachment  : 00000010
```

The attachment defined by the resulting bitmap is then applied.

```
Attachment bitmap    : 00000001
                   SET ||||||||
Required attachment  : 00000010
                     = ||||||||
Resulting bitmap       00000011
```

The resulting bitmap is then stored in the stack. In this example we removed Attachment B only to have it immediately
added back, but in practice, any situation that results in an attachment mutually-exclusive set being empty will add the
minimum attachment for that set back to the blaster.
