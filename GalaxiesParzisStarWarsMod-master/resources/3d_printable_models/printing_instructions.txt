1. Open the Stl file in the slicer of your choosing (I use Cura)
2. Slice the model and adjust settings for 3d printing. You shouldn't have to do much but make sure the preview looks like the model itself
3. Export as a .gcode file or send it directly to your 3d printer

20th scale models (1:20) mean that one minecraft block is equal to 5 cm (1.96 in)
40th scale models (1:40) mean that one minecraft block is equal to 2.5 cm (.98 in)

You can scale the prints to other sizes, of course, these are just the size they were designed to be printed at
You may notice that if you scale a model down, thin walls in the model will disappear

If you have any problems with the models themselves, just @Mikey in the PSWG discord. (Please don't DM me with issues)
