In 2015, Parzi's Star Wars Mod was launched as a cooperative effort to bring together my favorite cinematic and digital worlds. Working alongside the community, we brought to life some of the most in-depth and complex systems ever implemented in a Minecraft mod, and supported over a million players worldwide.

Today, I'm working again to create the **next generation** of mods which push the limit of the immersion possible within Minecraft, essentially using it as a game engine. This starts with Galaxies: Parzi's Star Wars Mod, which is slated to have **dozens of planets, locations, and landmarks** to explore, **hundreds of NPCs** to interact with, and **story-driven quests**.

## Building
PSWG builds using the Gradle build system. I recommend you use IntelliJ as an IDE. Simply import the gradle project, setup your development workspace, and build.

* Set up your development workspace by importing the Gradle project
* Decompile Minecraft sources: `gradlew genSources`
* All dependencies are met with Maven and are subsequently compiled into the resulting jarfile.
* Build a jarfile with `gradlew build` to produce `pswg-<version>.jar` in `./build/libs`. 

Recommended:

* [MinecraftDev IntelliJ IDEA Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327)
